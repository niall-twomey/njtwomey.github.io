title: "Releasing eHealth Analytics into the Wild: Lessons Learnt from the SPHERE Project"
description: "The SPHERE project is devoted to advancing eHealth in a smart-home context, and supports full-scale sensing and data analysis to enable a generic healthcare service. We describe, from a data-science perspective, our experience of taking the system out of the laboratory into more than thirty homes in Bristol, UK. We describe the infrastructure and processes that had to be developed along the way, describe how we train and deploy Machine Learning systems in this context, and give a realistic appraisal of the state of the deployed systems."
