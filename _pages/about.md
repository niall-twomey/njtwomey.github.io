I'm a lecturer / research fellow in computational behavioural analysis with machine learning at the University of Bristol. My research interests lie in machine learning, data science, artificial intelligence, and the application of these to healthcare (and recently in astronomy too). More specifically, my machine learning research is on the design and development of bespoke probabilistic and structural methods for these application areas.  

I intend this website to serve these purposes: 

1. To deliver a non-technical overview on my main research contributions from a practical and intuitive perspective; 
2. For easy access to some code snippets that I often find useful but that I don't use frequently enough to have committed to memory; and 
3. To store various notes on machine learning concepts that I've written in the past which I refer to sometimes.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to contact me through the links below or in the comments of the blog posts!
