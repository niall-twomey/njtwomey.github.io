I am an experienced and innovative researcher and in theoretical and applied machine learning. 

Machine learning research serves as a creative and intellectual outlet for me and the teams I work 
with and lead. 
My theoretical contributions to the field can be categorised into three key areas: uncertainty, 
structural and behavioural modelling.
I take on real-world problems in complex, high-risk domains that cannot generally be solved with 
out-of-the-box techniques.
I pride myself on continuously producing original research and never having failed to deliver strong 
and reliable models across a multiplicity of domains and problems.

From an applications perspective, I would loosely define myself as a 'generalist' in my direct work 
and leadership.
I have a proven track record of directly working with and managing research with many types of data 
sources (numeric, text, image, video, depth, skeletons, astronomy), sensors (accelerometers and other
wearables, environmental, video, LIDAR), label structures (sequences, hierarchical, dynamic, circular) 
at various levels of supervision (supervised, weak-supervised, semi-supervised, structured, fusion and
active and transfer learning) in real environments (data latency, data missingness). 
I am forward thinking in my modelling and research design where my models have coped with unexpected 
artefacts in real-world and live deployments. 

My research experience spans both academic and industrial settings. 
To date, I have authored approximately 50 peer-reviewed machine learning papers, and collaborated with 
over forty co-authors.
As well as deploying models to several healthcare settings, I have also brought several models to 
web-scale and millions live users. 
These models have been explicitly tailored to closely align with product needs, and deliver positive 
responses on core business metrics. 

I intend this website to serve these purposes: 

1. To deliver a non-technical overview on my main research contributions from a 
   practical and intuitive perspective; 
2. For easy access to some code snippets that I often find useful but that I don't
   use frequently enough to have committed to memory; and 
3. To store various notes on machine learning concepts that I've written in the 
   past which I refer to sometimes.
