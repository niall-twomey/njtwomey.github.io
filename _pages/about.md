I'm a research fellow / lecturer in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence at the University of Bristol. My research interests lie in the design and development of bespoke probabilistic and structural methods for digital health (and recently astronomy). I also have a keen research interest in data and model efficiency in applications with complex hetergeneous data and limited labels. 

I intend this website to serve these purposes: 

1. To deliver a non-technical overview on my main research contributions from a practical and intuitive perspective; 
2. For easy access to some code snippets that I often find useful but that I don't use frequently enough to have committed to memory; and 
3. To store various notes on machine learning concepts that I've written in the past which I refer to sometimes.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to contact me through the links below or in the comments of the blog posts!
